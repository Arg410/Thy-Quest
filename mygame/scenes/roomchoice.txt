*comment The following is all the rooms!!!!!

You find a ${ename} with ${EHP} HP and has Attack of ${EATT}
*label r1
What should we do?
*choice
  #Fight it (${attack} damage)
    *set EHP - attack
    *if (EHP > 0)
      You do ${attack} damage, ${ename} has ${EHP} HP left.
      *line_break
      *set HP - EATT
      It does a damage of ${EATT}, so you now have ${HP} HP
      *goto r1
    You fight and you win. You get ${EXP} XP and ${ecoins} coins
    *set XP + EXP
    *set coins + ecoins
    *line_break
    *goto_scene player
  #Use magic! (${magic} damage)
    *set EHP - magic
    *if (EHP > 0)
      You blast ${umag} at it. ${ename} now has ${EHP} HP
      *line_break
      *set HP - EATT
      It fights back and does ${EATT} damage, so you have ${HP} HP now
      *goto r1
  #Flee!!!
    You flee!!
    *goto_scene player
